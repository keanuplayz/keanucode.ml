Sure, you could do:\n```css\n.iajsdioajdo > .mdl-card-oof {\n    /* whatever */\n}\n```\nbut, `iajsdioajdo` could be some of those random classes like `mdl-color--white`. What if you wanted to apply a specific styling ONLY to the project cards, but have other cards on the page be unaffected?\n\nGuess what? **You can add your own classes to the elements!**\n\nSo you can make this:\n```html\n        <div class=\"iajsdioajdo\"> <!-- Project cards container -->\n            <div class=\"neet poyo mdl-card-oof\">  <!-- Card #1 -->\n                <h1>CCLoader</h1>\n                <p>huh. neat. text.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"neet poyo mdl-card-oof\">  <!-- Card #2 -->\n                <h1>CCInjector</h1>\n                <p>huh. neat. more text.</p>\n            </div>\n            <!-- ... more cards ... -->\n        </div>\n```\n\ninto this:\n\n```html\n        <div class=\"iajsdioajdo project-cards-container\"> <!-- Project cards container -->\n            <div class=\"neet poyo mdl-card-oof project-card\">  <!-- Card #1 -->\n                <h1 class=\"project-name\">CCLoader</h1>\n                <p class=\"project-description\">huh. neat. text.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"neet poyo mdl-card-oof project-cards\">  <!-- Card #2 -->\n                <h1 class=\"project-name\">CCInjector</h1>\n                <p class=\"project-description\">huh. neat. more text.</p>\n            </div>\n            <!-- ... more cards ... -->\n        </div>\n```"},"590984799418580994":{"u":2,"t":1560972156148,"m":"Just copy and paste an entire css class tutorial into here tbh","te":1560972171678},"590985104835477512":{"u":7,"t":1560972228965,"m":"And then style it like this:\n\n```css\n.project-cards-container { /* whatever */ }\n.project-cards-container > .project-card { /* whatever */ }\n.project-cards-container > .project-card > .project-name { /* whatever */ }\n/* ... */\n```"},"590985323681415168":{"u":7,"t":1560972281142,"m":"<@224155607278551040> Do you know of any good ones?
